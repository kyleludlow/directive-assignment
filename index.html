        <h1>Angular Directives</h1>

        <p>&nbsp; Directives are markers applied to DOM elements that allow Angular to manipulate their behavior using
            the HTML
            compiler. This can be done by using event listeners or by transforming the DOM element itself. Directives
            are basically javascript code that is defined inside the Angular module using .directive('name',
            function(){}) that can be called within the html document using a defined name instead of cluttering the
            html file with long snippets of code. this allows you to compile many lines of code into a neat html file
            while also adding functionality beyond regular html. An angular directive can be called as an html element,
            as attribute to an element, a class, or a comment. If any lengthy part of an html document needs to be
            repeated, defining a directive to inject that code is a good bet. Below are a couple of examples. The first
            example uses a directive to to easily insert an input and submit button into a an html document. This
            directive is used multiple times to save line-space. The second example is a directive containing a full
            form that may have to be used on multiple occasions. Both examples use templateUrl to link to html
            documents containing the lines of html code that replace the directive element in the index html file.

    <input-and-button></input-and-button>
    <br>
    <input-and-button></input-and-button>
    <br>
    <input-and-button></input-and-button>
